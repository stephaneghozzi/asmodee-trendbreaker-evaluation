# Evaluation of ASMODEE

ASMODEE is an outbreak detection algorithm, implemented as `asmodee` in the package [trendbreaker](https://github.com/reconhub/trendbreaker). Here it is evaluated on simulations (time series generated by the function `project` of the package [projections](https://github.com/reconhub/projections)) and on the English CCG's (see https://covid19-nhs-pathways-asmodee.netlify.app/).

(Further details coming soon.)

It takes about 2 hours to run on a laptop for model selection through AIC (`method=evaluate_aic`) and about 2 days with cross-validation (`method=evaluate_resampling`).
